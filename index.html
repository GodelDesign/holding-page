    <h1>Godel is winding down.</h1>
    <h4>Updated: 3rd February 2015</h4>
    <div class="message">
      <p>Godel is winding down operations, with the business halting operations completely on Friday, 27th February 2015.</p>
    </div>
    <p>We’ve had a fun ride as a digital agency for the past few years, but after a lot of introspection we’ve decided to make the tough decision to pursue other opportunities.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns, just get in touch with us on our work phone (<a href="tel:0459 642 694" class="link">0459 642 694</a>) before the final shutdown date.</p>
    <p>If you have an active contract with Godel, have recently worked with us, and are concerned you will have difficulties onboarding new developers, we can offer you an agency package outlining key information anyone would need to start work on your website immediately and will include:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li class="list-item">an export of any project management tools used to manage your site</li>
      <li class="list-item">current DNS, hosting and SSL details</li>
      <li class="list-item">any existing instructions/documentation/assets we may have on file for your website</li>
      <li class="list-item">a transfer of all your passwords for any accounts we have on file via secure email/PIN</li>
      <li class="list-item">transfer of ownership of any relevant accounts, including code repositories that may be registered under a Godel name or account</li>
      <li class="list-item">any other information specific to your project/website that we believe would be of key importance to another developer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The package is priced at $200 inc. GST and will be compiled upon request.</p>
    <p>Any outstanding invoices owed to Godel will also need to be finalised before the due date stated on the invoice. Overdue invoices will be referred to a professional debt collection agency.</p>
    <p>Luckily, all software that we've built for every client since day one has been built on rock-solid open source and/or well documented platforms, so there will be someone local available to help when you need. If you are looking for a new digital agency to manage your project, we can highly recommend any of these Melbourne-based groups who are all reputable, active participants in the local web community:</p>
